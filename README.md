# hippocampal_sequence_replay
A hippocampal model for behavioral time acquisition and fast bidirectional replay of spatio-temporal memory sequences

This github project contains the codes used in the simulations of the paper: A hippocampal model for behavioral time acquisition and fast bidirectional replay of spatio-temporal memory sequences. We make the codes public, so the results obtained can be reproduced. For now, I only provide a simple documentation on how to run the files currently available. I will provide a more complete documentation depending on the level of interest/requests received.

With all of the files in the same folder, run the file turn_ext_inhibition_off_trigger_detector_many_patterns.jl to obtain the data/plots corresponding to the encoding mode of the replays. Run the files synfiremode.jl and reversalreplay.jl to obtain the data/plots corresponding to the replays and reverse replays of place cells. Note that the current files only produce preliminary plots. I will upload the rest further in the future.
