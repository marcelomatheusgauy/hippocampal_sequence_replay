The figures present here were created when testing the files uploaded.
To generate new figures (with new data) run the files (turn_ext_inhibition_off_trigger_detector_many_patterns.jl;
synfiremode.jl; reversalreplay.jl) to simulate the model and save the data.
These produce preliminary plots in addition to the saving the necessary data.
Run files of form load_script* to produce plots that look similar to the ones in the paper
(these should provide template for rebuilding all the main plots). For other, more specific plots, the saved
data should be enough to produce whichever plot desired.
